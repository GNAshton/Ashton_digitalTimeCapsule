        <h1>GARRETT'S ACTIVITIES</h1>
        <p>While Garrett does not generally make his personal life and activities public on the internet, he does keep track of certain activities, thoughts, and reactions to media across various different sites in the form of logging and reviewing. Here we will see the places where these are tracked and the kind of footprint that he has through his various accounts.</p>

                    <h2>Backloggd: Game Journaling</h2>
                    <p>The video game tracking and logging website Backloggd allows you to not only keep track of the games you play, but also when, for how long, and other specific details such as the platform they are played on, how you own them, etc. On top of reviewing games, Garrett keeps track of games that he plays each and every day through the website's journaling system, which allows anyone to see when he plays games, including specifically when starting and finishing them, down to the date, as shown in the example below.</p>
